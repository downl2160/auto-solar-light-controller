Auto Solar Street Light Controller
This project automatically controls a street light based on ambient light using an LDR. Optionally, an IR sensor can be used to detect motion at night and brighten the light when someone is nearby.

Features
Turns light ON automatically at night

Turns OFF during daylight

Optional IR sensor for motion detection

Low-cost, school-friendly project

Technologies & Components Used
